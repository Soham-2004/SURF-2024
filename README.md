# Helium-3 Rich Period Detection in SEP Events

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events to detect Helium-3 (He-3) rich periods using both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. The analysis uses data from the Advanced Composition Explorer's Solar Isotope Spectrometer (ACE/SIS).

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to enhance the identification of He-3 rich periods during SEP events, crucial for understanding solar phenomena and their impacts on the heliospheric environment. We use two main approaches:

- **Supervised Learning Model**: A neural network classifier predicts He-3 rich periods based on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning Model**: K-means clustering is used to explore data patterns and potentially identify He-3 rich periods without prior labeling.
  
# Data
The data used in this project is derived from ACE/SIS data focusing on specific periods of interest.
